I have added individual elements to showcase some little features I have worked on. These do not include JavaScript and so will not have functionality.

The majority of JavaScript I have used is visible within the mini web projects.

When working on projects I tend to use a guideline at the top of the document that helps when figuring out spacing, colors and fonts. This helps with consistency in my projects in particular when a client has certain requirements/brand guidelines to meet.

Thanks for reading
Max
